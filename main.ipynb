The largest in materiel and manpower since the Battle of Mars, ﬁve long years ago. “We are responsible for this crisis. Lured by the false promises of an enemy plenipotentiary, we allowed our resolve to weaken. We allowed ourselves to believe in the better virtues of our enemy, and that peace was possible with tyrants. “That lie, seductive though it was, has been exposed as a cruel machination of statecraft designed, perpetrated, and executed by the newly appointed Dictator of the Society remnant, Atalantia au Grimmus—daughter of the Ash Lord.

Of the triumphant White Fleet that liberated Luna, Earth, and Mars, nothing remains but twisted shards and blackened hollows. Shattered by the might of the Ash Armada, the broken ships spin in orbit around the planet they liberated only months before. No longer ﬁlled with Martian sailors and legionnaires loyal to Eo’s dream, their cold halls are naked to vacuum and populated only by the dead. This is the last laugh of the Ash Lord, and the debut of his heir. While I burned the old warlord to death in his bed on Venus with Apollonius and Sevro, his daughter Atalantia stepped out from his shadow to take up his oﬀice of Dictator.

Her battered hull is sable, like the seashells I used to collect with my father on the shores of Luna’s Sea of Serenity. Unlike those glossy shells, she reﬂects no light. Her name is Annihilo. I annihilate. I hope that annihilation is not the total extent of Atalantia’s designs. “Big beast,” the man beside me says as if discussing the weather. “That killed Rhea?” I turn, wishing he were Cassius, but Cassius died trying to prevent this very moment.

Deeming it easier to change a planet than human nature, Gold worldmakers employed mass-drivers on Mercury to alter her rotational period to match Earth’s. Such heavyhanded terraforming is sometimes necessary, but it leaves visible seams. At the seam where the Sycorax Sea meets the polar ice, steam seeps from the wide mouth Harnassus’s blacksmiths cut into the façade of a glacier. Landing lights invite us into the glacier where a makeshift industrial world bustles around an excavation site. As we land, the sprawling barracks and engineering garages and mess halls on the ﬂoor look like toy blocks compared to the mass of metal being dug out of the ice.

Instead of the ceremonial armor appropriate for the reception of enemy dignitaries, Atalantia’s elite wear ﬁeld armor. Perhaps that is because they do not formally recognize the Rim’s independence. The beetle-black metal of the ﬁeld armor is dented and scuﬀed from war on four spheres. But the pearl House Grimmus skulls upon their breastplates are polished to a gleam. The slight was not meant to go unnoticed, nor does it. This is not the welcome for a prodigal son or an old ally. This is a presentation of force to blood traitors. As we pass the rows of hostile Grays, I wonder how many of them Atalantia pillaged from my Praetorians and my family legions. I search, but ﬁnd no Praetorians.

Flowers rot in vases, scum ﬂoats in shallow fountains, rooms are dusty and unlit, apples rot on the orchard grass.

Nothing rides the wind but sea hawks and gulls. I imagine them rushing home, just like the villagers, before the squall comes in full.

It is late afternoon and the songbirds have begun to croon for night. Rising guards patrol the fringes of the estate, looking at the sky, not knowing that the attack will come from within.

I move left, and they follow. “He can sense us.” Screwface believes it. “I noticed that too. Should we up the dosage?” “No.” “Darrow, we need to know when Atalantia will attack.” “She’s in no hurry,” I say. “But if we kill him before we get him to my wife—” I stop as I realize what I’m doing.

That shit nearly dropped my jaw. There’s always something bigger, ain’t there?” She is much like her name, which means “rough island” in ancient Gaelic. I doubt she knows how apt a name it is. The young Red wants to be inviting, but just can’t help being jagged around the edges. Alexandar does not notice the jaggedness one bit. Starlight ﬁlters through the glass dome, the light of certain stars ampliﬁed to cast columns of light over the models.
